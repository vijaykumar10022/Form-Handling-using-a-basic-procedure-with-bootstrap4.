## Django Forms:
  * Django provides a Form class which is used to create HTML forms. It describes a form and how it works and appears.

  * It is similar to the ModelForm class that creates a form by using the Model, but it does not require the Model.

  * Each field of the form class map to the HTML form &lt;input&gt; element and each one is a class itself, it manages form data and  
  performs validation while submitting the form.
